    "* data can be used to eliminate other data, what we can call \"redundant\" data --> removing credit_limit_ex_mort because something like credit_limit is enough, because a school enrollment commitee will never accept a student based on the assumption that the father will stop paying ortgage to pay for their school fee.\n",
